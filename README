nanoc site
==========

This is the source for the nanoc site (<http://nanoc.stoneship.org>). This
site is provided as an example to show off how nanoc can be used, and that
there is no need to keep your site source secret; none of it runs on the
server anyway.

Also check out the Stoneship site source, available in the Mercurial
repository at <http://nanoc.stoneship.org/hg/sites-stoneship>.
