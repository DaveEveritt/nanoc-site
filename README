nanoc site
==========

This is the source for the nanoc site (<http://nanoc.stoneship.org>). This
site is provided as an example to show off how nanoc can be used, and that
there is no need to keep your site source secret; none of it runs on the
server anyway.

Also check out the Stoneship site source, available in the Mercurial
repository at <http://nanoc.stoneship.org/hg/sites-stoneship>.

Requirements
------------

You will need nanoc 2.1 or higher, as well as:

* builder
* rubypants
* Hpricot

Branches
--------

The Mercurial repository for this site has a few branches:

* The _default_ branch contains the latest version of the public site that can
  be compiled with the latest released version of nanoc. This branch usually
  contains outdated stuff.

* The _future_ branch contains the latest version of the public site that can
  be compiled with the latest version from the Mercurial repository. This
  branch will likely be up-to-date.

* The _future-21_ branch contains the version of the site that will be made
  public when nanoc 2.1 is released. The site in this branch can only be
  compiled with the latest version from the Mercurial repository.

Once nanoc 2.1 is released, the _future-21_ branch will become the _default_
branch. When work on nanoc 2.2 is started, the _future_ branch will be used
when the site can only be compiled with nanoc 2.2 anymore, and a _future-22_
branch will be started.
