Wiki
----

The Trac-powered [wiki](http://projects.stoneship.org/trac/nanoc) contains a collection of useful tips and tricks. It also contains a list of sample nanoc sites (including this very site) which you can check out to improve your nanoc-fu.

Discussion Groups
-----------------

nanoc has a [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc) hosted at Google Groups. There probably is no better place to ask for help if you’re having trouble. In addition to that, there is a [Spanish discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc-es) for those who prefer to speak Spanish. (I won’t be able to join the discussion there though, as I don’t speak Spanish.)

IRC Channel
----------

There is a [nanoc IRC channel](irc://chat.freenode.net/#nanoc) named #nanoc at freenode. Feel free to drop to get support or discuss development.
