Discussion groups
-----------------

Nanoc has a [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc) hosted at Google Groups. There probably is no better place to ask for help if you’re having trouble.

IRC channel
----------

There is a [Nanoc IRC channel](irc://chat.freenode.net/#nanoc) named <span class="uri">#nanoc</span> at freenode. Feel free to drop to get support or discuss development. I’m not always around, so stick around for a while or send a message to the [Nanoc discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc) instead (see above).

GitHub
------

The [Nanoc GitHub repository](http://github.com/nanoc/nanoc) is where development happens, issues are discussed and pull requests reviewed. The process is open and anyone is invited to participate. Be sure to check out the [Contributing](/contributing/) page as well.

Wiki
----

The [Nanoc wiki](http://github.com/nanoc/nanoc/wiki) at GitHub contains a collection of useful tips and tricks, sample Nanoc sites (including this very site) which you can check out to improve your Nanoc-fu, third-party extensions and more. It is also the place where development-related brainstorming goes on.
