		<h3><span>Following Development</span></h3>

		<p>nanoc has a <a href="http://stoneship.org/svn/nanoc/">Subversion repository</a> in which all development happens.</p>

		<p>The Subversion directory structure is as follows. <span class="path">/nanoc</span> contains the actual source code for nanoc. The trunk is the main line of development, and there are branches for all supported releases. <span class="path">/samples</span> contains a few sample sites, including the nanoc site itself. Finally, <span class="path">/plugins</span> contains a few plugins you may find useful.</p>

		<p>The repository also is the only place where the tests live&mdash;they are not included in the gem or the tarball, since they are rather large.</p>

		<p>There also is a <a href="/trac">Trac installation for nanoc</a> which has a source code browser and a timeline, among other features, for tracking changes to the repository.</p>

		<h3><span>Enhancing nanoc</span></h3>

		<p>The easiest way to customize nanoc is to implement helper functions in Ruby source files that reside inside a site's <span class="path">lib</span> directory. Everything in these files will be available during the compilation process.</p>

		<p>It is possible to override built-in nanoc functions by re-implementing them. This is not recommended, as it relies on nanoc's internals which may change between releases, causing your site to break.</p>

		<p>You can also write custom filters, layout processors and data sources to extend nanoc. The <a href="/help/manual/chapter-3/">third chapter</a> of the nanoc manual explains how to do this.</p>

		<div class="section">
			<h4><span>Modifying nanoc's core</span></h4>

			<p>It is possible to modify nanoc's source code (that's why nanoc is open source). This is quite useful for fixing bugs, or even adding new features to nanoc. If you can, though, try enhancing nanoc in the ways specified above.</p>

			<p>If you have modified nanoc one way or another, I would <em>love</em> to see your changes. <a href="/trac/newticket">Create a ticket</a> on the nanoc Trac, attach a patch, and specify what version of nanoc this patch was made for. If I like your patch, I will include it in the standard nanoc distribution, and include you in the nanoc credits.</p>

			<p>A small word about licensing issues: nanoc is licensed under the MIT licence. To prevent legal issues, all your contributions to the nanoc core should also be under the MIT licence.</p>

			<p>nanoc comes with a large amount of unit tests. There unit tests are not included in the standard nanoc distribution, since this would make nanoc a lot larger than it is right now. You can get the tests from the Subversion repository (see above). If possible, run the unit tests to check whether your patch works. If you can't run unit tests or if some tests fail, send the patch to me anyway&mdash;I'll fix the issues.</p>

			<p>Any contribution to nanoc is more than welcome. Thanks in advance!</p>
