<p>nanoc 2.1.4 is out now. This release remedies a Windows-only bug which would cause the asset compiler to serve broken binary.</p>

<p>If you're running Windows, update your copy of nanoc the usual way by issuing the "gem update" command, like this:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc</kbd></pre>

<p>If you have any trouble with this nanoc release, please do let me know on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">mailinglist</a>. Enjoy!</p>
