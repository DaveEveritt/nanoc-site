nanoc 3.0.2 has been released. This release fixes a bug related to pattern matching in compilation and routing rules: in nanoc 3.0.1, the pattern `/foo/*/` would erroneously match `/foo/` as well--not in 3.0.2 anymore. There are some other tiny enhancements too; check the [release notes page](/about/release-notes/) for details.

**Important!** nanoc's gems are now hosted on [Gemcutter](http://gemcutter.org/), since this is [becoming the default host for Ruby gems](http://update.gemcutter.org/2009/10/26/transition.html). If you don't have Gemcutter yet, install using <kbd>gem install gemcutter</kbd> followed by <kbd>gem tumble</kbd> (to add Gemcutter to the list of gem sources).

When you have Gemcutter, updating nanoc3 is done the usual way, like this:

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> gem update nanoc3</kbd></pre>

<p>If you have any issues with this nanoc release, do let me know on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">mailinglist</a> or on the <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#nanoc">IRC channel</a>. Enjoy!</p>
