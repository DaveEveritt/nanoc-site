nanoc 3.0.4 has been released. This is a patch release that fixes a bug introduced in the previous patch release, 3.0.3, which could cause the filesystem_compact data source to incorrectly determine the content filename, leading to weird “Expected 1 content file but found 3” errors.

You can update nanoc3 the usual way, like this:

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc3</kbd></pre>
