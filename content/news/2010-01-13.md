nanoc 3.0.5 has been released. This is a patch release that restores pre-3.0.3 behaviour of periods in identifiers. By default, a file can have multiple extensions (e.g. content/foo.html.erb will have the identifier /foo/), but if `allow_periods_in_identifiers` in the site configuration is true, a file can have only one extension (e.g. content/blog/stuff.entry.html will have the identifier /blog/stuff.entry/).

So, if your site broke when using 3.0.3 or 3.0.4, update to 3.0.5 and everything will be fine again.

You can update nanoc3 the usual way, like this:

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc3</kbd></pre>
