title: The nanoc Logo Contest!
markdown: basic
---

nanoc has been around for over five and a half years. In all this time, its web site has been fairly bland and sadly devoid of a logo. It is time to change that! A brand new nanoc web site is being worked and will be hopefully be revealed early next year, and that web site needs a logo!

Are _you_ that capable designer that nanoc needs? Do you feel naked without a pencil in your hand? Then this should be a perfect fit for you! There are no rules, so let your creativity flow!

**What's in it for you?** nanoc doesn’t earn me any money (if you say that time equals money, then I’ve probably lost a few ten thousand euros! But at least it felt good). That means that t's hard for me to give a monetary reward. However, when you submit your logo design, tell me what you’d like for it and I’ll see what I can do. Perhaps I can buy you that Steam game that’s been sitting at the top of your wish list. Or perhaps you live in the neighbourhood and we’ll have a few drinks or even dinner together. Tell me your desires, and I’ll see what I can do!

**How do I submit?** You can’t yet. Sorry.
