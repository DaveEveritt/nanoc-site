* [Deploying nanoc sites](/docs/guides/deploying-nanoc-sites/) tells you how nanoc sites can be deployed efficiently. Of course, you can upload your site using FTP, but there are smarter ways.

* [Unit testing nanoc sites](/docs/guides/unit-testing-nanoc-sites/) shows how you can use nanoc’s check functionality to make sure that sites don’t contain any errors, such as broken links or invalid HTML.

* [Paginating articles](/docs/guides/paginating-articles/) is useful when you have a lot of articles that don’t fit on a single page. A way around that problem is splitting up the list of articles into multiple pages.

* [Using filters based on file extensions](/docs/guides/using-filters-based-on-file-extensions/) is something you’ll likely want to do. After all, you don’t want Textile and Markdown documents to be handled the same way.

* [Using binary items effectively](/docs/guides/using-binary-items-effectively/) is useful once you have a large collection of binary items, such as photos for a gallery, in your site.

* [Creating multilingual sites](/docs/guides/creating-multilingual-sites/) shows you how you can convert an existing site into a multilingual site, where the entire site is translated into different languages, where it is easy to switch to a different language and even how you can automatically detect the right language for the person browsing your site.
