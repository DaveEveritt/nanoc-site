<p>nanoc now has an IRC channel on freenode, aptly named <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#nanoc">#nanoc</a>. To join, connect to <i>chat.freenode.net</i> and join <i>#nanoc</i>.</p>

<p>This channel will be used for support and it will also function as a place to discuss development. I have recently begun working on nanoc 3.x, so be sure to drop by if you want to follow development. See you there!</p>
