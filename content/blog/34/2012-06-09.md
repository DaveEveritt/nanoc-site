nanoc 3.4 is out! This release brings a few useful improvements to the user interface along with some new and improved filters and commands.

When nanoc crashes, it will now write a `crash.log` file that contains a lot of extra debugging information that can be useful for tracking down the cause of a crash. The extra information includes the contents of the Gemfile.lock, the list of all installed gems, the `$LOAD_PATH` and the environment variables.

There is a new `show-rules` command that prints the compilation steps taken for every item. This could come in handy when figuring out why an item isn’t filtered as you expected it to be, or when an item isn’t written while it should be, for instance.

Some other enhancements include new Handlebars and Pandoc filters. Check out the [full release notes](/release-notes/) for details.

You can update your gems using `gem update` or, if you use Bundler, `bundle update`. 

If you have any questions, be sure to ask them on [the mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/). If you encounter issues, please do report them at [the issue tracker](https://github.com/nanoc/nanoc/issues)—thanks! You can also find me (and others) on the [nanoc IRC channel](irc://chat.freenode.net/#nanoc).

Enjoy!
