<p>nanoc 2.2.1 is out. This release fixes a few bugs introduced in nanoc 2.2.</p>

<p>First of all, the <code>relativize_path_to</code> helper function (part of the <code>LinkTo</code> helper) now <em>works</em>. A bug in the test cases unfortunately made all tests pass.</p>

<p>The <code>relativize_paths</code> filter has been split into two separate filters: <code>relativize_paths_in_html</code>, which relativizes paths in HTML code, and <code>relativize_paths_in_css</code>, which does the same for CSS.</p>

<p>As always, you can update your copy of nanoc by issuing the "gem update" command, like this:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc</kbd></pre>

<p>If you have any issues with this nanoc release, do let me know on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">mailinglist</a> or on the <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#nanoc">IRC channel</a>. Enjoy!</p>
