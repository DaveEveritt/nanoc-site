<p>Good news! nanoc 2.1 is (almost) feature-complete. Testing and documentation still need a bit more work, but it's well under way. My summer job is slowing down development a bit, so it'll take a few weeks before nanoc 2.1 is released.</p>

<p>Don't worry though! Today is the start of a series of articles describing nanoc 2.1 exciting new features. I'm calling this appetite-whetting series "What's New in nanoc 2.1" (which is <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/">not a ripoff at all</a>&mdash;honestly!). It's going to be so cool that I simply <em>had</em> to craft a shiny logo:</p>

<div style="margin: 1.8em 0; text-align: center;">
	<img src="/assets/images/whats-new-in-nanoc-21.png" alt="What's New in nanoc 2.1">
</div>

<p>Pretty. Maybe I should consider an art career. Anywayâ€¦ the first installment is probably going to be published this weekend, depending on how much time I have. Stay tuned!</p>
