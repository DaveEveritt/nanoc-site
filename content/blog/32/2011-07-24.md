After a long wait, nanoc 3.2 has been released. Major new points in this release include speed improvements, custom commands and a handful of new and updated filters. Check the [full release notes](/release-notes/) for details.

To update your nanoc install, simply

<pre><span class="prompt">%</span> <kbd>gem install nanoc</kbd></pre>

Below is an example of how to write custom commands for nanoc. You can use this to create your own HTML/CSS validation commands, deploy commands, blog maintenance commands and more. Read the [writing commands](/docs/5-advanced-concepts/#writing-commands) section of the manual for details.

	#!ruby
	usage       'dostuff [options]'
	aliases     :ds, :stuff
	summary     'does stuff'
	description 'This command does a lot of stuff. I really mean a lot.'
    
	flag   :h, :help,  'show help for this command' do |value, cmd|
	  puts cmd.help
	  exit 0
	end
	flag   :m, :more,  'do even more stuff'
	option :s, :stuff, 'specify stuff to do', :argument => :optional
    
	run do |opts, args, cmd|
	  stuff = opts[:stuff] || 'generic stuff'
	  puts "Doing #{stuff}!"
    
	  if opts[:more]
	    puts 'Doing it even more!'
	  end
	end
