<p>nanoc 2.1 is here! Update your nanoc version the usual way:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc</kbd></pre>

<p>There is no comprehensive changelog, but the "What's New in nanoc 2.1" series on this blog should give you a good idea of what is new (hence the name of the series). Here are the relevant posts:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/blog/2008-07-12/">improved CLI tool</a></li>
    <li><a href="/blog/2008-07-20/">an open framework</a></li>
    <li><a href="/blog/2008-07-21/">improved data sources</a></li>
    <li><a href="/blog/2008-07-23/">routers</a></li>
    <li><a href="/blog/2008-08-09/">assets</a></li>
    <li><a href="/blog/2008-08-11/">miscellaneous</a></li>
</ol>

<p>nanoc 2.1 is entirely backwards compatible with nanoc 2.0. This means that a site that can be compiled with nanoc 2.0 can be compiled without issues using nanoc 2.1.</p>

<p>A lot has changed between 2.0 and 2.1, so it is possible that you'll run into bugs. If something odd occurs, please do let me know either on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">mailinglist</a>, <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/trac/newticket">on Trac</a> or <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org/ddfreyne/nanoc/issues/new/">on Bitbucket</a>. I'll look into the issue as soon as possible and have it fixed in no time. Thanks for reporting!</p>
