<p>nanoc 2.0.1 is out. This tiny update brings a bug fix for a rather annoying "too many open files" error which occasionally popped up during compilation and auto-compilation.</p>

<p>If you've never been bitten by this bug, go back to work. If, on the other hand, this bug is making life unbearable for you, update your copy of nanoc using rubygems:</p>

<pre><kbd>sudo gem update nanoc</kbd></pre>
