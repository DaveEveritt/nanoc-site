<p>nanoc 2.1.5 is out now. Included in this release is compatibility with Ruby 1.9, and a fix for a bug which would cause the <code>extensions</code> attribute for assets to be ignored completely.</p>

<p>Update your copy of nanoc the usual way by issuing the "gem update" command, like this:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc</kbd></pre>

<p>If you have any trouble with this nanoc release, please do let me know on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">mailinglist</a> or the <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#nanoc">IRC channel</a>. Enjoy!</p>
