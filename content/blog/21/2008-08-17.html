<p>nanoc 2.1 is entirely backwards compatible with nanoc 2.0. This means that a site that can be compiled with nanoc 2.0 can be compiled without issues using nanoc 2.1.</p>

<p>A lot has changed between 2.0 and 2.1, so it is possible that you’ll run into bugs. If something odd occurs, please do let me know either on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">mailinglist</a>, <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/trac/newticket">on Trac</a> or <s>on Bitbucket</s>. I’ll look into the issue as soon as possible and have it fixed in no time. Thanks for reporting!</p>
