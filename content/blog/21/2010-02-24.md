nanoc 3.0.8 is out. This patch release fixes a couple of issues with the Blogging helper, and makes the autocompiler serve up-to-date pages when requesting an index file. See the <a href="/about/release-notes/">release notes</a> for details.

You can update nanoc3 the usual way, like this:

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc3</kbd></pre>

<p>If you have any issues with this nanoc release, do let me know on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">mailinglist</a> or on the <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#nanoc">IRC channel</a>. Enjoy!</p>
