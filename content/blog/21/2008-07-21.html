<p>This is the third installment of <i>What’s New in nanoc 2.1</i>. This article discusses the new data sources, which have been improved a lot in nanoc 2.1.</p>

<p>To recap: data sources are classes that tell nanoc where to find site content. Even though you’ll usually stick to storing your pages as files on the filesystem, you may want to store the in a database instead, or maybe simply store them in a different way on the filesystem.</p>

<p>For example, one big difference between nanoc and one of its competitors, webby, is that the latter stores its pages as single files, and not directories. Webby stores its metadata embedded inside pages. nanoc 2.1 comes with a new data source named <i>filesystem_combined</i> which, similar to webby, <strong>stores content and attributes in a single file</strong>. This can clean up the <span class="path">content</span> directory quite a bit.</p>

<p>Here’s what the default nanoc site looks like with a filesystem_combined data source:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">-----
# Built-in

# Custom
title: Home
-----

&lt;h1&gt;A Brand New nanoc Site&lt;/h1&gt;

… rest of the content goes here …</code></pre>

<p>Creating a new site with this new <i>filesystem_combined</i> data source is easy. Just do this (the <kbd>-d</kbd> switch specifies the name of the data source):</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">%</span> nanoc create_site -d filesystem_combined my_new_site</kbd></pre>

<p>If you want to switch your existing site over to <i>filesystem_combined</i>, you can do that with a <strong>brand new <kbd>switch</kbd> command</strong>, which you invoke like this:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">%</span> nanoc switch -d filesystem_combined</kbd></pre>

<p>If your site is stored in a <abbr title="version control system">VCS</abbr> repository such as Subversion, git, Mercurial or Bazaar, you can  <strong>tell nanoc to use this VCS' commands</strong> using the <kbd>-c</kbd> switch. At the moment, nanoc supports svn, git, hg and bzr, but adding support for new VCSes is trivial. As an example, here’s how you’d switch to switch to new data source using git:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">%</span> nanoc switch -d filesystem_combined -c git</kbd></pre>

<p>If you want to get a list of supported VCSes, use the <strong>new <kbd>info</kbd> command</strong> (which also gives information about available filters, data sources, and more), which outputs something like this:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">%</span> nanoc info</kbd>

<samp>VCSes:

  builtin:
    bazaar, bzr         (Nanoc::Extra::VCSes::Bazaar)
    dummy               (Nanoc::Extra::VCSes::Dummy)
    git                 (Nanoc::Extra::VCSes::Git)
    mercurial, hg       (Nanoc::Extra::VCSes::Mercurial)
    subversion, svn     (Nanoc::Extra::VCSes::Subversion)
  custom:
    (none)

… more stuff here …</samp></pre>

<p>The original filesystem data source you’re all used to (which is simply called <i>filesystem</i>) has been updated a bit. <strong>Layouts are now stored as directories</strong> instead of files, and in the new meta file you can specify the name of the filter to use when rendering this layout. The filter used for compiling layouts is no longer dependent on the file extension.</p>

<p>There’s <strong>a new <kbd>update</kbd> command</strong> to make updating the site content (e.g. updating the way layouts are stored) easier. Here’s how you’d use it for a site versioned using Mercurial:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">%</span> nanoc update -c hg</kbd></pre>

<p>The data sources now also <strong>allow creating, updating and deleting stored data</strong>. This is probably not very useful for the commandline interface&mdash;after all, why have <kbd>delete_page</kbd> and <kbd>move_page</kbd> when there’s the standard unix commands <kbd>rm</kbd> and <kbd>mv</kbd>, respectively&mdash;but for new frontends (GUI frontend, web-based frontend, …) this may become quite useful later on.</p>

<p>A last important new feature is <strong>data sources now provide modification times</strong> for the data they read, which makes it possible for nanoc to only compile outdated pages, which creates a nice speed improvement.</p>

<p>So, that’s what data sources in nanoc 2.1 look like. Stay tuned for the third installment of <i>What’s New in nanoc 2.1</i>!</p>
