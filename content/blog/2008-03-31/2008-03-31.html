<p>We're moving the nanoc repository from Subversion to Mercurial. There are quite a few reasons for that, but it's mostly because Mercurial is hot these days.</p>

<p>The new repositories are located <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/hg/">over here</a>. There are separate repositories for each plugin, each sample site, and of course nanoc itself.</p>

<p>For all the gory details, check out the <a href="/development/">development page</a> which has been updated with lots of details on how to use Mercurial.</p>
