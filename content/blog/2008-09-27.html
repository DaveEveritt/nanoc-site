<p>nanoc 2.1.3 is now available. This bug-fixing release fixes a few issues I'll quickly explain.</p>

<p>First of all, there was a bug which would prevent Haml and Sass filters from being used in assets. Secondly, layouts named "index" are now handled correctly (due to backward compatibility, "index" was handled differently). Finally, the <code>filesystem_combined</code> data source now supports assets (a bug prevented assets from working there).</p>

<p>Additionally, the autocompiler now serves index files when requesting a directory (quite similar to Apache's <code>DirectoryIndex</code> or lighttpd's <code>index-file.names</code>). Index files that are not created by nanoc but still appear in the output directory (as the result of a rake task, for example) will therefore be served instead of returning a 404.</p>

<p>You can update your copy of nanoc the usual way by using the "gem update" command like this:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc</kbd></pre>

<p>If you have any trouble with this nanoc release, please do let me know on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">mailinglist</a>. You can always report bugs <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/trac/newticket">on Trac</a> (preferred), <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org/ddfreyne/nanoc/issues/new/">on Bitbucket</a> and even on the <a href="http://nanoc.kenai.com/">brand new nanoc project site at Kenai</a>. Thanks!</p>
