<p>nanoc 2.1.6 has been released. This version fixes a handful of bugs and improves compatibility with third-party utilities.</p>

<p>Pages and assets that use the <code>filesystem_combined</code> data source can now have an empty metadata section. Previously, you'd get weird nil errors and the like.</p>

<p>The <code>rdoc</code> filter now supports both RDoc 1.x and RDoc 2.x.</p>

<p>The autocompiler has been improved in several ways. First of all, it serves asset content correctly. Previously, nanoc would sometimes simply serve outdated compiled data instead.</p>

<p>Secondly, the asset compiler now reports errors more accurately. When an exception occurs somewhere in the asset compiler, it will be reported.</p>

<p>Lastly, the autocompiler no longer serves index files (such as <span class="path">index.html</span>) if a request is made for a directory and the request path does not end with a slash. For example, the file <span class="path">about/index.html</span> will not be served when the request path is <span class="path">/about</span> instead of <span class="path">/about/</span>.</p>

<p>You can, as always, update your copy of nanoc by issuing the "gem update" command, like this:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc</kbd></pre>
