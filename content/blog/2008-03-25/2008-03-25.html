<p>nanoc 2.0.3 is out and solves a few autocompiler-related issues. Custom paths are now honored, and the autocompiler now serves files that are not compiled by nanoc with the correct MIME type.</p>

<p>As always, you can update simply by doing:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc</kbd></pre>
