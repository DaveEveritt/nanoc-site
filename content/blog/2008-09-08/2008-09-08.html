<p>nanoc 2.1.2 has arrived. This minor release makes the autocompiler work with assets as well (that's a bugâ€”and I have no idea how I could miss that).</p>

<p>The updated Sass filter accepts options now, just like the Haml filter. The Haml/Sass options are now taken from the page <em>representation</em> instead of the page itself, which means different representations of the same page can have different Haml/Sass options.</p>

<p>As always, you can update your copy of nanoc by issuing the "gem update" command, like this:</p>

<pre><kbd><span class="prompt">></span> sudo gem update nanoc</kbd></pre>

<p>If you stumble upon a bug, please do let me kno on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/">mailinglist</a>, on <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org/ddfreyne/nanoc/issues/new/">on Bitbucket</a> or <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/trac/newticket">on Trac</a>. Thanks!</p>
