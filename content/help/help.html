	<h2><span>Help</span></h2>

	<p>Self-documenting software is really cool. Imagine not having to write any documentation at all! Such software does not exist in the real world, though, so I've written quite a bit of helpful material that should teach you everything there is to know about nanoc.</p>

	<h3><span>Tutorial</span></h3>
	
	<p>The tutorial is the ideal place to get started with nanoc. It tells you how to install nanoc, what you need to use nanoc, and obviously how to use nanoc as well. <a href="/help/tutorial/">Read tutorial &raquo;</a></p>

	<h3><span>Manual</span></h3>

	<p>The manual is an in-depth guide about all of nanoc's aspects. It is divided into three chapters: one explaining nanoc's philosophy, one detailing how to use nanoc, and one teaching you how to extend nanoc by writing your own plugins. <a href="/help/manual/">Read manual &raquo;</a></p>

	<h3><span>Wiki</span></h3>

	<p>The Trac-powered <a href="/trac/">wiki</a> contains a collection of useful tips and tricks. It also contains a list of sample nanoc sites (including this very site) which you can check out to improve your nanoc-fu.</p>

	<h3><span>Other Resources</span></h3>

	<p>If you need help but you've run out of help files, do <a href="https://nanoc.stoneship.org/trac/newticket">open a support ticket</a>, explain your problem, and I'll help you out as soon as possible.</p>
