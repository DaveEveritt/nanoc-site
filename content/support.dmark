#p If you need help with Nanoc, beyond what the %ref[item=/doc/about.*]{documentation} offers, you have several choices, use %ref[url=https://github.com/nanoc/nanoc/discussions]{GitHub discussions} or join the %ref[url=https://groups.google.com/d/forum/nanoc]{Google group}. Both are a low-activity places that are ideal for asking for assistance.

#p Additionally, I (Denis) offer paid support for Nanoc. If you are interested, fill out the %ref[url=https://forms.gle/f6NEPSXs4wKG6U366]{paid support request form}. Filling out the form carries no commitment; it is just a conversation starter.
